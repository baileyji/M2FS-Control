After opkg upgrade got:
Collected errors:
 * pkg_get_installed_files: Failed to open //var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-build.pm.list: No such file or directory.
 * pkg_get_installed_files: Failed to open //var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-load.pm.list: No such file or directoryroot@beaglebone:/home# 
Resolved by:
I recently had the same issue.  As it turns out, there are files named perl-module-build.list and perl-module-load.list in /var/lib/opkg/info.  While it feels like a hack solution, I simply created symbolic links to those files, i.e.,
$: ln -s /var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-build.list /var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-build.pm.list
$: ln -s /var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-load.list /var/lib/opkg/info/perl-module-load.pm.list
Also:
error with update-alternatives and "watch" fixed by manually editing (e.g. vim)  /var/lib/opkg/alternatives/watch to point to /usr/bin/watch instead of /bin/watch.

depmod fixed "could not load â€¦ modules.dep"
