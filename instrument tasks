Tasks

Move to the Filter Loading Position
  Add task to appropriate galil queue

Insert a chosen filter
	Add task to appropriate galil queue
	
Set the [HRAZ|LRTLT|HRTLT|FOC] position
	Add task to appropriate galil queue
  
Select [HiRes|LoRes] mode
  Add task to appropriate galil queue
	
Select slit [1-6] for  Tetris [1-8]
	Activate FLS Subsystem
	If slit # or tetris # are invalid return error
	If desired slit is already selected return else
	Determine region to illuminate
	Command projector to draw pattern

	If slit is not calibrated calibrate slit else
	Tell Tetris x to move to estimated leading edge of slit
	During move count minima/maxima in FLSIM image
	If wrong number of slits seen then error
	Move ~1/3 way to slit center
	Compare illumination profile with expected and compute number of additional steps to take
	Take those steps
	If illumination is not in valid range error
	Set desired slit as selected slit fro tetris x
	store slit poitioning data

Activate FLS Subsystem
	GalilR: Insert FLSIM
	GalilB: Insert FLSIM	
	¿TCS: Insert CALUNIT?
	FLSIM On
	FLSPROJ On
	Set integration time of imager
	grab frames in sync with VS pulse
	If FLSPROJ isn't calibrated, calibrate it

Deactivate FLS Subsystem
	GalilR: Remove FLSIM
	GalilB: Remove FLSIM	
	¿TCS: Remove CALUNIT?
	FLSIM Off
	FLSPROJ Off

Exit slit positioning mode
	Deactivate FLS Subsystem

Set current plate & setup
	load hole/star/fiber data from saved setups data

Upload (email?) plate files
	if files are invalid error
	store files to setups data
	load setup in file if only one uploaded

Verify fiber plug positions are correct
	Activate FLS Subsystem
  if plate & setup not set then error
	ensire all slits are on a slit
	Galil: Insert FLSIM arm
	TCS: Insert Secondary arm
	Power up FLSIM
	Set integration time of imager
	Power up FLSPROJ
	prime fiber testing loop
	execute fiber testing loop
	if fiber is plugged incorrectly tell CM arduino to display fiber ID and play appropriate sound
	once all fibers are plugged properly tell plugging time



Exit plugging mode
	on exit of mode record fiber/hole mapping
	Deactivate FLS Subsystem


Report the instrument status
	Query Galils for needed status information
	Query FLSPROJ for needed status information 
	Report software information
	Reply with needed status information

Communicate with GUI computer
	Listen for messages on eth1 port X and handle them
	
Communicate with Engineering computer
  Run engineering webpage

Reprogram Galil
	find out if R or B
	dowload appropriate code to galil
	update udev device info
	
Reprogram datalogger
	find out if location
	dowload appropriate code to datalogger
	update udev device info

Reprogram secondary arduino
	to be done manually, for now

Communicate with galil
maintains queue of galil tasks & coordinates communication
while run queue isn't empty
	Query Galil for free threads
	for each free thread deque a task and execute it
	wait awhile
