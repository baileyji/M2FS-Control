        Pass the command string along to the guider agent.
        The response callback is the command's setReply function.
        
        This routine implements the same functionality as
        shackhartman_command_handler, but in a different manner.
        Using the errorCallback is much cleaner and removes dependence on an
        additional function, but does not provide direct control over the error
        messages.
