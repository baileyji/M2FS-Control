Python-PyNUT is an abstraction class written in Python to access NUT (Network UPS Tools) servers.

You can use it in Python programs to access NUT without having to manually connect to NUT
using a telnetlib connection or something similar. You have not to know how to speak the NUT
protocol too (PyNUT knows it for you ;) )

To import it on Python programs you have to use the following (case sensitive) :

'import PyNUT'


Have fun.
