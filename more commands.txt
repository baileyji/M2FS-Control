Go to slit X open loop
  if position unknown 
    move to hardstop
    zero position
  move to nominal position of slit X 

Go to slit X closed loop
  if current slit == desired
    return
  turn on imager and illuminate fibers
  if position unknown
    move to hardtop
    zero position
  move to closed slit position, counting peaks, fail if wrong N
  if blank desired, return
  move up to nominal slit position, counting peaks, fail if wrong N
  maximize light


SLITPOS Get/Set nominal position of slit X
Get nominal position (X, moving, unknown)
Get illumination profile
Get illumination measure
Set active hold position on/off
Move X steps
Move to hardstop & zero
Set Imager settings(image composting/exposure time)
Set projector settings(color, brightness)

Advanced closed loop calibration that tries to avoid hard stop
	if see dark
	  drive down at most max d above top slit or until see light
	if still see dark
	  drive up at most max d below bottom slit or until see light
	if still see dark
	  fail
	else
	  maximize light
	  drive up slit above & below
		  slit above & blackness below
		  slit below & blackness above

======================================


stop
set plate/setup
Is plugging subsys online
check which fibers plugged where
turn plugging mode on/off
report fiber plug positions
test hole X -> yield fiber plugged into that hole
checking rate goal
get list of misplugged fibers
turn on/off audio feedback
Set Imager settings(image composting/exposure time)
Set projector settings(color, brightness)
