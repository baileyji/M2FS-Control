Needs to make director attempt a reconnect to the agent when it is next needed, and if the reconnect fails reply to the command with an error. perhaps including a time delay for init to restard the errant process.

need to implemnet a wait and retry if agent is started and the server socket is busy


validate code execution in event director is running but agent is not because it died 
validate code execution in event director is running but agent is not because it was never running

why is a bad galil connection causing the handled socket to the GUI to fail? we are getting a socket.error exception in handle read on the gui connection socket after sending a command when there is no connection to the galil, wtf Or perhaps not!

check to see if shutdown is needed when we must kill the socket
